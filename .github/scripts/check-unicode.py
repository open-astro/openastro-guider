"""Scan tracked text files for dangerous/invisible Unicode characters.

Guards against "Trojan Source" attacks (CVE-2021-42574), where bidirectional
control characters or invisible code points make source render differently from
how the compiler reads it.

Run from the repo root:  python3 .github/scripts/check-unicode.py
Exits non-zero (and prints file:line:col U+XXXX) if any forbidden code point is
found. Intentional control characters in tests should be written as escapes
(e.g. "\\u200E") rather than literal characters so the source stays clean.

Detection does NOT depend on a file decoding cleanly as UTF-8, and it does not
silently pass anything it fails to inspect -- both are bypasses a security
control must not have:

  * Genuine binaries are skipped (a NUL byte, and no UTF-16/UTF-32 BOM).
  * UTF-8 and BOM-declared UTF-16 / UTF-32 text are decoded and scanned for
    precise file:line:col reporting.
  * Any remaining undecodable *text* file is flagged (a non-UTF-8 text file is
    anomalous in a UTF-8 tree) and byte-scanned for the forbidden code points
    in every encoding that can carry them.
  * A tracked file that cannot be read at all (broken symlink, bad perms) is a
    hard finding -- never skipped silently. Directory targets of tracked
    symlinks (e.g. macOS .framework internals) are not files and are skipped.

Known accepted limitation: a UTF-16/UTF-32 text file with NO byte-order mark is
indistinguishable from binary by the NUL heuristic and is skipped. Such a file
is not valid source for this tree's toolchains (which read UTF-8), so it is not
a realistic vector here.
